    "## 1. Domain-specific area (rewrite)\n",
    "In this work, we present a text classifier for detecting fake news. Fake news, also known as misinformation, refers to false or misleading information presented as if it were real news. It has become a major issue in recent years, with the proliferation of social media platforms and the ease with which false information can be disseminated. The negative impact of fake news cannot be understated, as it can lead to harm to individuals and society as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this problem, we have developed a machine learning-based text classifier that can accurately identify fake news articles. The classifier is trained on a large dataset of real and fake news articles, and uses various features of the text, such as word counts and sentiment, to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate the performance of the classifier using several metrics, and show that it is able to achieve high accuracy in detecting fake news. We also discuss the potential applications of the classifier, including its use by news organizations to fact-check articles, and by social media platforms to combat the spread of fake news."

    "## 2. Objectives (add references)\n",
    "This project aims to find a suitable way to perform text classification in news articles in order to classify if the article is or is not fake news. In order to adapt ourselves to the social media era and avoid the spread of misinformation we need to improve the ways we validate what is truth and what is not. Historically, we've seen that fake news can contribute to problems such as:\n",
    "1. Damaging the reputation of people through spreading misinformaiton. [reference]\n",
    "2. Advertise false propaganda in order to misguide elections and/or election results. [reference]\n",
    "3. Generate confirmation bias manipulating one's perception of reality. [reference]\n",
    "4. Estimulating conflicts in a situation where polarity is arising in society. [reference]\n",
    "\n",
    "We've also seen the widespread of fake news during COVID which, according to studies [reference], have been one of the causes of vaccine hesitancy, which has lead to unnecessary deaths all over the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work consists in an automated way to fact-check news in order to tackle the problems above and many more."
